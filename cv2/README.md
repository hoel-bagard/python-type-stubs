## Opencv stubs
A stub file with all the cv2 function can be found on the [Microsoft stubs repo](https://github.com/microsoft/python-type-stubs/tree/main/cv2).

However, this stub did not suit me, so I'm writing my own subset (it contains only the functions I use). The typing of those functions is also wrong in the sense that OpenCV handles many more types than the ones I use.
